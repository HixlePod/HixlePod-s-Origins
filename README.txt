HixlePod's Origins is a project that started in mid-September of 2022 and has been activley worked on as of 2023. This mod adds custom origins requested by memebers of the minecraft server and it's discord ranging between flight, the sea and other dimensions.

Each origin is given the option to have 2 abilities with no pet or 1 ability and 1 pet, Some pets are given abilities of their own but are usually not as strong as player abilities. Players can also have positive and negative passive abillities that add more character to their origin.

In addition to the origins this mod also adds new dimensions, entities blocks, items & other fatures that may be useful to give more character to origins.
